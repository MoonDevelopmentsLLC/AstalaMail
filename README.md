AstalaMail - A Webmail Client.

A webmail client designed for privacy enthusiasts, productivity seekers, and multi-account power users.


🌟 Overview

AstalaMail redefines email management by combining privacy-first architecture with seamless integration of any email provider's native web client. Whether you use Gmail, Outlook, ProtonMail, or a custom domain, AstalaMail organizes your inboxes while preserving the unique features of each service. Theres no need to juggle many email apps or acclimate to "universal" clients that maintain only one UI independent of a providers featureset. Say goodbye to fragmented workflows and hello to a productivity-centric experience that adapts to your needs—not the other way around.

Why AstalaMail?

    🛡️ Zero Compromises on Privacy: Your data stays with you and your chosen providers.

    🚀 Native Provider Integration: Access Gmail labels, Outlook calendars, ProtonMail encryption, and more—all in one app.

    ⚡ Designed for Speed: The bottleneck is the internet speed.

🎯 Features
🔒 Privacy by Design

    No Data Harvesting: We don’t mine your emails, track behavior, or sell analytics.

    Local Storage: All email data stays on your device unless explicitly sent.

🌐 Universal Provider Support

    Native Web Client Embedding: Directly embed your provider’s web interface (e.g., Gmail’s compose window) within AstalaMail’s UI.

❓ FAQ

Q: How does AstalaMail differ from Thunderbird or Mailspring?
A: We don’t reinvent the wheel—we integrate providers' native UIs, so you never lose features like Gmail’s Smart Compose or Outlook’s Sweep Rules. We also don't access or have user data.

Q: Can I use this with a custom domain?
A: Absolutely! IMAP/SMTP support works with any provider, including self-hosted solutions like Mailcow.

Q: Is there mobile support?
A: Android!

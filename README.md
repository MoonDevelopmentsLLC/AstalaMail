# AstalaMail 


A webmail client designed for privacy enthusiasts, productivity seekers, multi-account power users, and anyone really.


🌟 Overview

AstalaMail redefines email management by combining privacy-first architecture with seamless integration of any email provider's native web client. Whether you use Gmail, Outlook, ProtonMail, or a custom domain, AstalaMail organizes your inboxes while preserving the unique features of each service. Theres no need to juggle many email apps or acclimate to "universal" clients that maintain only one UI independent of a providers featureset.

Why AstalaMail?

    🛡️ Zero Compromises on Privacy: Your data stays with you and your chosen providers.

    🚀 Provider Webmail Integration: Access Gmail labels, Outlook calendars, ProtonMail encryption, and more—all in one app.
         When your provider updates their webmail, its used immediately, no time consumption on your end.

    ⚡ Designed for Speed: The bottleneck is the internet speed.

    End-to-End Encryption (Future): Implementation for auto encryption of emails across all hosts.

    Local Storage: All data stays on your device, providers/hosts won't know your other providers/hosts

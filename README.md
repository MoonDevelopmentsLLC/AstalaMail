Last updated 5/14/2025 - First pre-alpha test<br>
A webmail client designed for privacy enthusiasts, productivity seekers, multi-account power users, and anyone really.

🌟 Overview

AstalaMail conducts email management by combining privacy-first architecture with integration of any email provider's native web client. Whether you use Gmail, Outlook, ProtonMail, or a custom domain, AstalaMail organizes your inboxes while preserving the unique features of each service. Theres no need to juggle many email apps or acclimate to "universal" clients that maintain only one UI independent of a providers featureset.

Why AstalaMail?

    🛡️ Zero Compromises on Privacy: Your data stays with you and if applicable, your chosen providers.

    🚀 Provider Webmail Integration: Access Gmail labels, Outlook calendars, ProtonMail encryption, and more—all in one app.
         When your provider updates their webmail, its used immediately, no time consumption on your end.

    ⚡ Designed for Speed: The bottleneck is the internet speed.

🎯 Features
🔒 Privacy by Design

    No Data Harvesting: I don’t mine your emails, track behavior, or sell analytics. I don't use telemetry and don't include logs in pre-compiled builds. (Stripped by compilation)

    End-to-End Encryption (Future): Implementation for auto encryption of email sent across all hosts.

    Local Storage: All data stays on your device, providers/hosts won't know your other providers/hosts

❓ FAQ

Q: How does AstalaMail differ from Thunderbird or Mailspring? <br>
A: MoonDevelopmentsLLC doesn't access or have user data and won't change the policy and is available on mobile. Its not reinventing the wheel—Astalamail integrates providers' native webmail UIs, so you theorhetically don't lose features like Gmail’s Smart Compose or Outlook’s Sweep Rules. 

Q: Can I use this with a custom domain?<br>
A: Absolutely! IMAP/SMTP support works with any provider, including self-hosted solutions like Mailcow. The only requirement is a web interface. Pure imap support is a -WIP-

Q: Release cycle? Software support? <br>
A: Maintained as long as MoonDevelopments is around or a community is there for it.

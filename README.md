Last updated 5/14/2025 <br> First pre-alpha test<br>
A webmail client designed for privacy enthusiasts, productivity seekers, multi account power users, and anyone really.

ðŸŒŸ Overview

AstalaMail conducts email management by combining privacy architecture with integration of any email provider's native web client. Whether you use Gmail, Outlook, ProtonMail, or a custom domain, AstalaMail organizes your inboxes while preserving the unique features of each service. Theres no need to juggle many email apps or acclimate to "universal" clients that maintain only one UI independent of a providers featureset.

Why AstalaMail?

    Zero Compromises on Privacy: Your data stays with you and if applicable, your chosen providers.

    Provider Webmail Integration: Your providers native interface means when your provider updates their webmail, its used immediately, no time consumption on your end.

    Designed for Speed: The bottleneck is the internet speed.

What do you mean zero compromises on privacy?

    No Data Harvesting: I donâ€™t mine your emails, track behavior, or sell analytics. I don't use telemetry and don't include logs in pre-compiled builds.

    End-to-End Encryption (Future): Implementation for auto encryption of email sent across all hosts based on self defined parameters in a trustless system.

    Local Storage: All data stays on your device, providers/hosts won't know your other providers/hosts.

Examples of some features in the works : 

    Unified Inbox: View all accounts in one feed or split them into workspaces. -WIP-

    Smart Labels: Apply labels across providers (e.g., "Work" = Gmailâ€™s "Work" + Outlookâ€™s "Projects"). -WIP-

    Dark/Light Mode: With customizable accent colors. -WIP-
    
    Cross-Account Search: Find "invoice.pdf" across Gmail, ProtonMail, and self-hosted accounts instantly. -WIP- Locally, only if user iniated list load occurs. -WIP

    Batch Operations: Delete/archive 1000 emails from 5 providers in one click. -WIP-

        Currently stored encrypted with AES, but this is in the very first beta release, use at your own risk on rooted devices. If you are not rooted, it should be safe if you trust your vendor.


FAQ

Q: How does AstalaMail differ from Thunderbird or Mailspring? <br>
A: MoonDevelopmentsLLC doesn't access or have user data and won't change the policy and is available on mobile. Astalamail integrates providers' native webmail UIs, so you theorhetically don't lose features like Gmailâ€™s Smart Compose or Outlookâ€™s Sweep Rules. 

Q: Can I use this with a custom domain?<br>
A: The only requirement is a web interface with a link. Pure imap support is a -WIP-

Q: Release cycle? Software support? <br>
A: Maintained as long as MoonDevelopments is around or a community is there for it.
